# Amazon delivery sentiment analysis
## Requirements
AWS account.
## How I did it.
Using an [ec2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/) (to speed up the sentiment analysis process), I used the [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) library to scrape 5713 tweets (limit for me) from 2010 to 2020, I put them all in a [RDS database](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/rds/) and I pre-processed all these tweets (filter spam) using this pre-trained [model](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-sms-spam-detection) (I know it's an SMS and not tweets spam detector but I ran a lot of tests and it turned out to be the more accurate).

Then, with the spam tweets gone, I began the sentiment analysis with this pre-trained [model](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest),

## What to conclude from that ?

### Note that I am not a data scientist or analyst, I am just a student who loves trying things out.
From these results, we can see that, the part of negative tweets increase significantly over the years, and the part of positive tweets is decreasing since 2017.
Though it is not enough to make conclusions, this gap between number of positive/negative tweets can be explained with many things, the spam and sentiment classification algorithm. Moreover, rare are the persons who tweet nice things on Twitter, it is more likely to see bad things there ðŸ˜‚.
